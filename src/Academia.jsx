		It started with the desire to understand the process of muscle hypertrophy
		and hopefully modulate it. Although I had joined the laboratory of exercise
		physiology at UFMG, that theme wasn't on the table, so I had to go along the
		lab themes of fatigue and thermoregulation.

		Once my bachelors was done, I scored a position in the masters programme of
		biology of physical activity at the University of Jyväskylä (Finland).
		I had the pleasure and honour of having Juha Hulmi as my supervisor, a very
		knowledgeable guy in muscle matters &#x1F4AA;

		After some months back home, I managed to secure a scholarship from the
		<i>Science Without Borders</i> programme from the Brazilian Ministry
		of Education. And so we went to Lund (Sweden) to continue working on muscle
		dystrophies, this time congenital instead of Duchenne, and microRNAs.

		Continuing on the theme of non-coding RNAs, I moved to Odense (Denmark) for
		my first post-doc stint, this time working with lncRNAs and obesity. I got to
		learn a lot of molecular biology and the basics of cell culture.

		My last post-doc was at the University of Eastern Finland, working on cell
		cycle and leukaemia. I got to explore some CRISPR techniques for genetic
		engineering and expanded my skills in cell culture.

		All this journey was every now and then spiced up with some bioinformatics
		work, which reinforced my passion for coding. Although there are many
		interesting things in bioinfo, I still see it largely as data science applied
		to biology; and I'm more of a software developer. And it's really nice to see
		more positions for software developers appearing at universities and research
		groups and facilities. Who knows? I might be able to combine the best of both
		worlds &#x1F60E;
