    <p>I'm a coder interested in back end development, automation and testing.</p>
    <p>Since March 2023 I'm a student at <a href='https://koodsisu.fi'>kood/Sisu</a>, where we learn full stack development. We started with Go for the back end, which I really enjoyed, and now are tackling JS.</p>
    <p>My practical experience revolves around Python for scientific computing. Given it can also be used for back end development, I want to improve my skills in frameworks such as Flask, FastAPI and Django.</p>
    <p>At school, we can choose up to 2 specialisation modules, of which I'm planning to take DevOps/cloud and cybersecurity. I think it nicely matches my skills and interests: Python is widely used in automation, which is an important aspect of DevOps, and both Python and Go are used in cybersecurity.</p>
    <p>Another goal of mine is to contribute to open source, be it through an existing project or creating something new that would help the community.</p>
